# Program Compilers 1 project

-The project is about implementing the compiler for MicroJava (a made up programming language which is similar to Java, but simpler).

-MicroJava source files are compilet to bytecode, which is then executed by MicroJava virtual machine (MicroJava VM is a simple interpretative emulator).

-By the specification, it supports namespaces, if else statements, arrays, for loops, upacking of arrays (check documentation for more details) and classes (polymorphism) with static fields and static initializers.

# Principles of software engineering project

-This project was done in a team of 4 with and the idea was to develop a web application and go through the different phases of building an application:
1) Writing the specification
2) SSU documents and prototypes
3) Formal inspection
4) Modeling the database
5) Implementation of the application
6) Modeling the application 
7) Testing the application

- Our application is called EPutuj, and it's a ride-sharing platform connecting drivers with empty seats to passengers traveling in the same direction. Users can also request specific rides, and drivers can schedule those rides.

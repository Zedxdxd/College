# Data security project

-The project is about implementing the PGP protocol with simple GUI in PyQt5.

-It was done in pairs (me and @milica-cvetkovic).

-It supports basic logging in and registration, creation and deletion of RSA keys and sending messages (saving files locally)

-Encryption is done with AES or DES.
